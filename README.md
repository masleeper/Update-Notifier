# Yurupdate
Discord bot that checks a specific Google Doc for edits. On change, a message is sent to indicating a change. This bot is hosted on GCP with a Node.js runtime using Express to take care of incoming HTTP requests. Google's Drive API is used for checking of changes. Discord.js is used for all bot logic.
